A small (mostly undercooked) monogame wrapper, made for a personal project and as an oppurtunity to learn Monogame.

Most basic features are in the wrapper, but it is still incomplete and is subject to change/updates with no notice.
Sample project should provide some guidance if you plan to use it.
