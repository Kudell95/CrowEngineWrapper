# UntitledCardGame
 
This is a project i created to learn monogame, It's a (fairly undercooked) engine wrapper for Monogame.
has a functioning ECS, basic renderer and basic scene system. - May turn this into a more usable solution in the future as i was originally going to use this to create a game, but it has now morphed into just an engine wrapper project.
