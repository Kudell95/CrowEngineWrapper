# Crow Engine Wrapper
 
This is a project i created to learn monogame, It's a (fairly undercooked) engine wrapper for Monogame.
has a functioning Entity/Component system, some basic components (sprite2d, renderer2d etc...) and a basic scene system.

May turn this into a more usable solution in the future as i was originally going to use this to create a game,
but it has now morphed into just an engine wrapper project.
